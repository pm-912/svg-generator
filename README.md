# SVG Generator #

## Application Description ##
This is a simple command line application that dynamically 
generates a logo with text. The User is prompted with questions 
for the text content, shape, and color of each. The app will
take those answers and render a new SVG file with their choices

## How it Works ##
The application runs using JavaScript, Node.js, inquirer, and jest.
The user starts the application by running node index.js in their
command line. Node then reads the file, and asks the user the four
questions supplied. The application then takes those answers, and 
creates a shape of their choosing, filled with whatever text they 
supplied. The shape and text are also colored based on the user's
input.
