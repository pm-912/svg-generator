## Description ##
  This is a simple command line application that dynamically 
  generates a logo with text. The User is prompted with questions 
  for the text content, shape, and color of each. The app will
  take those answers and render a new SVG file with their choices

## Usage ##
  The application runs using JavaScript, Node.js, inquirer, and jest.
  The user starts the application by running node index.js in their
  command line. Node then reads the file, and asks the user the four
  questions supplied. The application then takes those answers, and 
  creates a shape of their choosing, filled with whatever text they 
  supplied. The shape and text are also colored based on the user's
  input.
